        This will calculate the forces for 6 displacements per atom +/-x,

        started. Be aware that an interrupted calculation may produce an empty
        file (ending with .pckl), which must be deleted before restarting the
        job. Otherwise the forces will not be calculated for that
        displacement.

        Note that the calculations for the different displacements can be done
        simultaneously by several independent processes. This feature relies
        on the existence of files and the subsequent creation of the file in
